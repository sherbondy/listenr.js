listenr.js
==========

An attempt to recreate my iPhone app,
[Listenr](http://www.listenrapp.com), in JavaScript using
[SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com) and, minimally,
[node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) in time for
the [SproutCore Demo App Hackathon](http://demohackathon.strobeapp.com/)
this Sunday.

It's Thursday, just past midnight.
I have never used SproutCore before.

Friday, again just past midnight.
Got OAuth working nicely.
Ready to dive into sproutcore this evening after work.
Decided to make server essentially a dumb pipe to the
Tumblr API. All heavy lifting will happen on the client
side. See what SproutCore can do.

To run listenr.js on your own machine, move
`server/secrets_placeholder.js` to `server/secrets.js`
and input your own made-up session secret and your
Tumblr OAuth Consumer Key and Secret Key.

Saturday, 3:30am. Some decent progress tonight.
Basic list of songs in Dashboard.
